# Reflection:
## 1. Identify any challenges or issues you encountered while writing your functions.
- Putting except, raise inside try-exception structure and understanding Exception type was challenging for me. 
- As I created several functions inside my code, I couldn't remember which functions do which things.  
- understanding function's structure was also challenging for me.
## 2. Discuss the benefits and challenges of developing and using unit tests.
- As the codes gets longer and longer, It was kind of hard to remember and understand what code does what fuction. So I decide to put more explanations in it.
- Using new module such as Unit Test was difficult at the first time. It gives me several benefits, however i think it is difficult to understand how to use each functions.
- It is really beneficial when I try to use unit tests to test each module or part without being interrupted by other codes.
